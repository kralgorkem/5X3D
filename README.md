Had to do an 5 axis 3d printer for my school project. Found this :(https://github.com/rcKeith/Marlin) edited it and made it 5 Axis. 

Couldn't get the extruder motor and hotend work on reprap ramps1.4

Made a custom start screen.

Even tho hotend doesn't work it shows the temperature at homescreen with a suitable board other than ramps 1.4 it should work but I have no chance to try it unluko.

GL if u will work about this.
